      <h3 class="top3">diversity scholarship</h3>
      <p>
        The United States PostgreSQL Association manages a $10,000 fund for our Diversity Scholarship. The goal of the scholarship is to encourage diversity of participation
	in PostgreSQL conferences and events. 6 applicants have been granted scholarships to attend events such as PgDay Chicago and PgConf NYC in 2023. You can apply for the
	Diversity Scholarship using this
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/postgresql.us/forms/d/1dgFUVXHgJ0sLAETJaAciLFetvFq5_S0-juZ3g8QyeVc/edit?usp=sharing&ts=58f14198">application form</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can apply to have some or all of your conference attendance costs (registration, hotel, airfare) covered. Just like submitting a talk, details count!
        Your application should include specifics of how attending the event will benefit you, and how you plan to share the benefit with others in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision making process will be based on a mixture of criteria such as scholarship applicability, benefit to the appliant, their plan to give back to the community,
        seriousness of the application, logistical factors and budget remaining. Each committee member will vote on these applications and based on that we will reach out to you
	with an email confirming whether your application was accepted or rejected and the scholarship amount approved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Diversity Committee would like to thank our friends and members of the Django community for allowing us to review and borrow from their program.
